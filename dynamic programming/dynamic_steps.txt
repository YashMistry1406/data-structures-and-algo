2 ways of solving a dynamic programming problem are
i-tabulation(Bottom up)
ii-memoization(top down)

steps that could be followed to derive a top down approach :-
1- think of a recursive solution 
2- check which variables are changing on every function call (these will be the dimension of the 2d matrix
  we would create for the top down approach)
3-now code for the top down approach by creating a matrix of the changing variables
  and fill the initial values of the matrix 
4-
