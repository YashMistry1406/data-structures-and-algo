#Explanation
#We save the construction path in a stack.
#In each loop,
#we get the number level of '-'
#we get the value val of node to add.
#
#If the size of stack is bigger than the level of node,
#we pop the stack until it's not.
#
#Finally we return the first element in the stack, as it's root of our tree.
# Definition for a binary tree node.
